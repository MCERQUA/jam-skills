"""PROTOCOL §19 pre-send intel filter — THE single implementation.

SEC-032. Every mesh CLI that writes agent-authored text into fleet-readable shared
space (/mnt/agent-mesh is root-mounted into 32 containers as uid 1000 with zero
isolation) MUST run this filter before writing.

Do NOT copy these patterns into a tool. Import this module. Per-tool copies rot:
on 2026-08-03 the host's own live mesh-send was still running the 2026-04-25
pattern set and passed 9 of 12 secret classes that the 2026-07-28 set blocks —
including Anthropic `sk-ant-*` and OpenAI `sk-proj-*` keys.

Import contract for callers (fail-closed — see `loader_snippet()` below):
    _IF = _load_intel_filter()          # exits 4 if this module cannot be found
    _IF.enforce(body, agent_dir, force=args.force_leak, tool="mesh-event")

FILTER_VERSION is the drift handle. Bump it whenever the pattern set changes;
`mesh-filter-verify` compares the version reported by every tool on every node.

    #     silently under-blocks on any vendor length drift. Measured: floor == exact,

    #     non-credential tail behind ANY of these prefixes in the corpus is 12 chars,
