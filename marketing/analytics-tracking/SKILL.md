# Analytics Tracking

You are an expert in analytics implementation and measurement. Your goal is to help set up tracking that provides actionable insights for marketing and product decisions.

## Initial Assessment

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Before implementing tracking, understand:

1. **Business Context** - What decisions will this data inform? What are key conversions?
2. **Current State** - What tracking exists? What tools are in use?
3. **Technical Context** - What's the tech stack? Any privacy/compliance requirements?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Track for Decisions, Not Data
- Every event should inform a decision
- Avoid vanity metrics
- Quality > quantity of events

### 2. Start with the Questions
- What do you need to know?
- What actions will you take based on this data?
- Work backwards to what you need to track

### 3. Name Things Consistently
- Naming conventions matter
- Establish patterns before implementing
- Document everything

### 4. Maintain Data Quality
- Validate implementation
- Monitor for issues
- Clean data > more data

## Tracking Plan Framework

### Structure

```
Event Name | Category | Properties | Trigger | Notes
---------- | -------- | ---------- | ------- | -----
```

### Event Types

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Pageviews | Automatic, enhanced with metadata |
| User Actions | Button clicks, form submissions, feature usage |
| System Events | Signup completed, purchase, subscription changed |
| Custom Conversions | Goal completions, funnel stages |

**For comprehensive event lists**: See [references/event-library.md](references/event-library.md)

---

## Event Naming Conventions

### Recommended Format: Object-Action

```
signup_completed
button_clicked
form_submitted
article_read
checkout_payment_completed
```

### Best Practices
- Lowercase with underscores
- Be specific: `cta_hero_clicked` vs. `button_clicked`
- Include context in properties, not event name
- Avoid spaces and special characters
- Document decisions

---

## Essential Events

### Marketing Site

| Event | Properties |
|-------|------------|
| cta_clicked | button_text, location |
| form_submitted | form_type |
| signup_completed | method, source |
| demo_requested | - |

### Product/App

| Event | Properties |
|-------|------------|
| onboarding_step_completed | step_number, step_name |
| feature_used | feature_name |
| purchase_completed | plan, value |
| subscription_cancelled | reason |

**For full event library by business type**: See [references/event-library.md](references/event-library.md)

---

## Event Properties

### Standard Properties

| Category | Properties |
|----------|------------|
| Page | page_title, page_location, page_referrer |
| User | user_id, user_type, account_id, plan_type |
| Campaign | source, medium, campaign, content, term |
| Product | product_id, product_name, category, price |

### Best Practices
- Use consistent property names
- Include relevant context
- Don't duplicate automatic properties
- Avoid PII in properties

---

## GA4 Implementation

### Quick Setup

1. Create GA4 property and data stream
2. Install gtag.js or GTM
3. Enable enhanced measurement
4. Configure custom events
5. Mark conversions in Admin

### Custom Event Example

```javascript
gtag('event', 'signup_completed', {
  'method': 'email',
  'plan': 'free'
});
```

**For detailed GA4 implementation**: See [references/ga4-implementation.md](references/ga4-implementation.md)

---

## Google Tag Manager

### Container Structure

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Tags | Code that executes (GA4, pixels) |
| Triggers | When tags fire (page view, click) |
| Variables | Dynamic values (click text, data layer) |

### Data Layer Pattern

```javascript
dataLayer.push({
  'event': 'form_submitted',
  'form_name': 'contact',
  'form_location': 'footer'
});
```

**For detailed GTM implementation**: See [references/gtm-implementation.md](references/gtm-implementation.md)

---

## UTM Parameter Strategy

### Standard Parameters

| Parameter | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| utm_source | Traffic source | google, newsletter |
| utm_medium | Marketing medium | cpc, email, social |
| utm_campaign | Campaign name | spring_sale |
| utm_content | Differentiate versions | hero_cta |
| utm_term | Paid search keywords | running+shoes |

### Naming Conventions
- Lowercase everything
- Use underscores or hyphens consistently
- Be specific but concise: `blog_footer_cta`, not `cta1`
- Document all UTMs in a spreadsheet

---

## Attribution and Offline Conversions

For a local service business the money event is usually **not** on the website — it's a phone
call, a booked job, or a signed quote, often days later. Web-only conversion data systematically
over-credits last-click and under-credits whatever actually generated the call.

### Attribution Model

- GA4 defaults to data-driven attribution; Google Ads reports its own conversions separately —
  state which model each number uses before comparing them. Treating the two as the same measure
  is the most common bad number in a client report.
- Low-volume local accounts (roughly under 300 conversions/month) don't have the volume for
  data-driven attribution to be meaningful. Say so rather than presenting it as precision.

### Offline Conversion Import

The high-value wiring for a local business: capture the click id on the form or call, then send
the *outcome* back when the job actually closes.

1. Capture `gclid` (or `wbraid`) on landing (`?gclid=...`) and store it with the lead record.
2. On close, upload `gclid` + conversion time + value to Google Ads (Offline Conversion Import),
   or to GA4 via the Measurement Protocol.
3. Bid on the imported "job closed" conversion — not on "form submitted."

```bash
# GA4 Measurement Protocol — send a closed job server-side
curl -s -X POST \
  "https://www.google-analytics.com/mp/collect?measurement_id=$GA4_ID&api_secret=$GA4_SECRET" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"client_id":"'"$CLIENT_ID"'","events":[{"name":"job_closed",
       "params":{"value":4200,"currency":"CAD","lead_source":"google_ads"}}]}'
# Validate against the /debug/mp/collect endpoint FIRST — it returns validationMessages.
# The live endpoint returns 204 for malformed payloads too, so a 204 is NOT proof it was accepted.
```

### Common Issues

| Issue | Check |
|-------|-------|
| Offline conversion rejected | Click older than Google Ads' ~90-day window, or <24h since the click |
| GA4 sessions/users look wrong after import | `client_id` set to a CRM id instead of the real GA client id — this creates a new user per upload and breaks session stitching |
| "Accepted" but never shows up | A 204 from the live Measurement Protocol endpoint means received, not valid — re-check against `/debug/mp/collect` |
| Numbers double-counted | Both the web `form_submit` and the offline `job_closed` uploaded as the same conversion action |
| No click id to import | Visitor declined ad storage/consent — do not backfill a guess |

**Do not** report web conversions and CRM closes side by side as if they measure the same thing,
and do not change the attribution model mid-reporting-period.

## Debugging and Validation

### Testing Tools

| Tool | Use For |
|------|---------|
| GA4 DebugView | Real-time event monitoring |
| GTM Preview Mode | Test triggers before publish |
| Browser Extensions | Tag Assistant, dataLayer Inspector |

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Events firing on correct triggers
- [ ] Property values populating correctly
- [ ] No duplicate events
- [ ] Works across browsers and mobile
- [ ] Conversions recorded correctly
- [ ] No PII leaking

### Common Issues

| Issue | Check |
|-------|-------|
| Events not firing | Trigger config, GTM loaded |
| Wrong values | Variable path, data layer structure |
| Duplicate events | Multiple containers, trigger firing twice |

---

## Privacy and Compliance

### Considerations
- Cookie consent required in EU/UK/CA
- No PII in analytics properties
- Data retention settings
- User deletion capabilities

### Implementation
- Use consent mode (wait for consent)
- IP anonymization
- Only collect what you need
- Integrate with consent management platform
