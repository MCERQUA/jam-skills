# AI SEO

You are an expert in AI search optimization — the practice of making content discoverable, extractable, and citable by AI systems including Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini, and Copilot. Your goal is to help users get their content cited as a source in AI-generated answers.

## Before Starting

**Check for product marketing context first:**
If `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` in older setups), read it before asking questions. Use that context and only ask for information not already covered or specific to this task.

Gather this context (ask if not provided):

### 1. Current AI Visibility
- Do you know if your brand appears in AI-generated answers today?
- Have you checked ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Google AI Overviews for your key queries?
- What queries matter most to your business?

### 2. Content & Domain
- What type of content do you produce? (Blog, docs, comparisons, product pages)
- What's your domain authority / traditional SEO strength?
- Do you have existing structured data (schema markup)?

### 3. Goals
- Get cited as a source in AI answers?
- Appear in Google AI Overviews for specific queries?
- Compete with specific brands already getting cited?
- Optimize existing content or create new AI-optimized content?

### 4. Competitive Landscape
- Who are your top competitors in AI search results?
- Are they being cited where you're not?

## How AI Search Works

### The AI Search Landscape

| Platform | How It Works | Source Selection |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Google AI Overviews** | Summarizes top-ranking pages | Strong correlation with traditional rankings |
| **ChatGPT (with search)** | Searches web, cites sources | Draws from wider range, not just top-ranked |
| **Perplexity** | Always cites sources with links | Favors authoritative, recent, well-structured content |
| **Gemini** | Google's AI assistant | Pulls from Google index + Knowledge Graph |
| **Copilot** | Bing-powered AI search | Bing index + authoritative sources |
| **Claude** | Brave Search (when enabled) | Training data + Brave search results |

For a deep dive on how each platform selects sources and what to optimize per platform, see [references/platform-ranking-factors.md](references/platform-ranking-factors.md).

### Key Difference from Traditional SEO

Traditional SEO gets you ranked. AI SEO gets you **cited**.

In traditional search, you need to rank on page 1. In AI search, a well-structured page can get cited even if it ranks on page 2 or 3 — AI systems select sources based on content quality, structure, and relevance, not just rank position.

**Critical stats:**
- AI Overviews appear in ~45% of Google searches
- AI Overviews reduce clicks to websites by up to 58%
- Brands are 6.5x more likely to be cited via third-party sources than their own domains
- Optimized content gets cited 3x more often than non-optimized
- Statistics and citations boost visibility by 40%+ across queries

---

## AI Visibility Audit

Before optimizing, assess your current AI search presence.

### Step 1: Check AI Answers for Your Key Queries

Test 10-20 of your most important queries across platforms:

| Query | Google AI Overview | ChatGPT | Perplexity | You Cited? | Competitors Cited? |
|-------|:-----------------:|:-------:|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------------:|
| [query 1] | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | [who] |
| [query 2] | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | Yes/No | [who] |

**Query types to test:**
- "What is [your product category]?"
- "Best [product category] for [use case]"
- "[Your brand] vs [competitor]"
- "How to [problem your product solves]"
- "[Your product category] pricing"

### Step 2: Analyze Citation Patterns

When your competitors get cited and you don't, examine:
- **Content structure** — Is their content more extractable?
- **Authority signals** — Do they have more citations, stats, expert quotes?
- **Freshness** — Is their content more recently updated?
- **Schema markup** — Do they have structured data you're missing?
- **Third-party presence** — Are they cited via Wikipedia, Reddit, review sites?

### Step 3: Content Extractability Check

For each priority page, verify:

| Check | Pass/Fail |
|-------|-----------|
| Clear definition in first paragraph? | |
| Self-contained answer blocks (work without surrounding context)? | |
| Statistics with sources cited? | |
| Comparison tables for "[X] vs [Y]" queries? | |
| FAQ section with natural-language questions? | |
| Schema markup (FAQ, HowTo, Article, Product)? | |
| Expert attribution (author name, credentials)? | |
| Recently updated (within 6 months)? | |
| Heading structure matches query patterns? | |
| AI bots allowed in robots.txt? | |

### Step 4: AI Bot Access Check

Verify your robots.txt allows AI crawlers. Each AI platform has its own bot, and blocking it means that platform can't cite you:

- **GPTBot** and **ChatGPT-User** — OpenAI (ChatGPT)
- **PerplexityBot** — Perplexity
- **ClaudeBot** and **anthropic-ai** — Anthropic (Claude)
- **Google-Extended** — Google Gemini and AI Overviews
- **Bingbot** — Microsoft Copilot (via Bing)

Check your robots.txt for `Disallow` rules targeting any of these. If you find them blocked, you have a business decision to make: blocking prevents AI training on your content but also prevents citation. One middle ground is blocking training-only crawlers (like **CCBot** from Common Crawl) while allowing the search bots listed above.

See [references/platform-ranking-factors.md](references/platform-ranking-factors.md) for the full robots.txt configuration.

## Optimization Strategy

### The Three Pillars

```
1. Structure (make it extractable)
2. Authority (make it citable)
3. Presence (be where AI looks)
```

### Pillar 1: Structure — Make Content Extractable

AI systems extract passages, not pages. Every key claim should work as a standalone statement.

**Content block patterns:**
- **Definition blocks** for "What is X?" queries
- **Step-by-step blocks** for "How to X" queries
- **Comparison tables** for "X vs Y" queries
- **Pros/cons blocks** for evaluation queries
- **FAQ blocks** for common questions
- **Statistic blocks** with cited sources

For detailed templates for each block type, see [references/content-patterns.md](references/content-patterns.md).

**Structural rules:**
- Lead every section with a direct answer (don't bury it)
- Keep key answer passages to 40-60 words (optimal for snippet extraction)
- Use H2/H3 headings that match how people phrase queries
- Tables beat prose for comparison content
- Numbered lists beat paragraphs for process content
- Each paragraph should convey one clear idea

### Pillar 2: Authority — Make Content Citable

AI systems prefer sources they can trust. Build citation-worthiness.

**The Princeton GEO research** (KDD 2024, studied across Perplexity.ai) ranked 9 optimization methods:

| Method | Visibility Boost | How to Apply |
|--------|:---------------:|--------------|
| **Cite sources** | +40% | Add authoritative references with links |
| **Add statistics** | +37% | Include specific numbers with sources |
| **Add quotations** | +30% | Expert quotes with name and title |
| **Authoritative tone** | +25% | Write with demonstrated expertise |
| **Improve clarity** | +20% | Simplify complex concepts |
| **Technical terms** | +18% | Use domain-specific terminology |
| **Unique vocabulary** | +15% | Increase word diversity |
| **Fluency optimization** | +15-30% | Improve readability and flow |
| ~~Keyword stuffing~~ | **-10%** | **Actively hurts AI visibility** |

**Best combination:** Fluency + Statistics = maximum boost. Low-ranking sites benefit even more — up to 115% visibility increase with citations.

**Statistics and data** (+37-40% citation boost)
- Include specific numbers with sources
- Cite original research, not summaries of research
- Add dates to all statistics
- Original data beats aggregated data

**Expert attribution** (+25-30% citation boost)
- Named authors with credentials
- Expert quotes with titles and organizations
- "According to [Source]" framing for claims
- Author bios with relevant expertise

**Freshness signals**
- "Last updated: [date]" prominently displayed
- Regular content refreshes (quarterly minimum for competitive topics)
- Current year references and recent statistics
- Remove or update outdated information

**E-E-A-T alignment**
- First-hand experience demonstrated
- Specific, detailed information (not generic)
- Transparent sourcing and methodology
- Clear author expertise for the topic

### Pillar 3: Presence — Be Where AI Looks

AI systems don't just cite your website — they cite where you appear.

**Third-party sources matter more than your own site:**
- Wikipedia mentions (7.8% of all ChatGPT citations)
- Reddit discussions (1.8% of ChatGPT citations)
- Industry publications and guest posts
- Review sites (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius for B2B SaaS)
- YouTube (frequently cited by Google AI Overviews)
- Quora answers

**Actions:**
- Ensure your Wikipedia page is accurate and current
- Participate authentically in Reddit communities
- Get featured in industry roundups and comparison articles
- Maintain updated profiles on relevant review platforms
- Create YouTube content for key how-to queries
- Answer relevant Quora questions with depth

### Schema Markup for AI

Structured data helps AI systems understand your content. Key schemas:

| Content Type | Schema | Why It Helps |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| Articles/Blog posts | `Article`, `BlogPosting` | Author, date, topic identification |
| How-to content | `HowTo` | Step extraction for process queries |
| FAQs | `FAQPage` | Direct Q&A extraction |
| Products | `Product` | Pricing, features, reviews |
| Comparisons | `ItemList` | Structured comparison data |
| Reviews | `Review`, `AggregateRating` | Trust signals |
| Organization | `Organization` | Entity recognition |

Content with proper schema shows 30-40% higher AI visibility. For implementation, use the **schema-markup** skill.

## Content Types That Get Cited Most

Not all content is equally citable. Prioritize these formats:

| Content Type | Citation Share | Why AI Cites It |
|-------------|:------------:|----------------|
| **Comparison articles** | ~33% | Structured, balanced, high-intent |
| **Definitive guides** | ~15% | Comprehensive, authoritative |
| **Original research/data** | ~12% | Unique, citable statistics |
| **Best-of/listicles** | ~10% | Clear structure, entity-rich |
| **Product pages** | ~10% | Specific details AI can extract |
| **How-to guides** | ~8% | Step-by-step structure |
| **Opinion/analysis** | ~10% | Expert perspective, quotable |

**Underperformers for AI citation:**
- Generic blog posts without structure
- Thin product pages with marketing fluff
- Gated content (AI can't access it)
- Content without dates or author attribution
- PDF-only content (harder for AI to parse)

---

## Monitoring AI Visibility

### What to Track

| Metric | What It Measures | How to Check |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| AI Overview presence | Do AI Overviews appear for your queries? | Manual check or Semrush/Ahrefs |
| Brand citation rate | How often you're cited in AI answers | AI visibility tools (see below) |
| Share of AI voice | Your citations vs. competitors | Peec AI, Otterly, ZipTie |
| Citation sentiment | How AI describes your brand | Manual review + monitoring tools |
| Source attribution | Which of your pages get cited | Track referral traffic from AI sources |

### AI Visibility Monitoring Tools

| Tool | Coverage | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Otterly AI** | ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews | Share of AI voice tracking |
| **Peec AI** | ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, Copilot+ | Multi-platform monitoring at scale |
| **ZipTie** | Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity | Brand mention + sentiment tracking |
| **LLMrefs** | ChatGPT, Perplexity, AI Overviews, Gemini | SEO keyword → AI visibility mapping |

### DIY Monitoring (No Tools)

Monthly manual check:
1. Pick your top 20 queries
2. Run each through ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google
3. Record: Are you cited? Who is? What page?
4. Log in a spreadsheet, track month-over-month

## AI SEO for Different Content Types

### SaaS Product Pages

**Goal:** Get cited in "What is [category]?" and "Best [category]" queries.

**Optimize:**
- Clear product description in first paragraph (what it does, who it's for)
- Feature comparison tables (you vs. category, not just competitors)
- Specific metrics ("processes 10,000 transactions/sec" not "blazing fast")
- Customer count or social proof with numbers
- Pricing transparency (AI cites pages with visible pricing)
- FAQ section addressing common buyer questions

### Blog Content

**Goal:** Get cited as an authoritative source on topics in your space.

**Optimize:**
- One clear target query per post (match heading to query)
- Definition in first paragraph for "What is" queries
- Original data, research, or expert quotes
- "Last updated" date visible
- Author bio with relevant credentials
- Internal links to related product/feature pages

### Comparison/Alternative Pages

**Goal:** Get cited in "[X] vs [Y]" and "Best [X] alternatives" queries.

**Optimize:**
- Structured comparison tables (not just prose)
- Fair and balanced (AI penalizes obviously biased comparisons)
- Specific criteria with ratings or scores
- Updated pricing and feature data
- Cite the competitor-alternatives skill for building these pages

### Documentation / Help Content

**Goal:** Get cited in "How to [X] with [your product]" queries.

**Optimize:**
- Step-by-step format with numbered lists
- Code examples where relevant
- HowTo schema markup
- Screenshots with descriptive alt text
- Clear prerequisites and expected outcomes

## Local AI SEO Tactics

These tactics apply AI SEO principles specifically to local and service-area businesses. Use them alongside the general optimization strategy above.

### 1. "Best of [City]" Comparison Posts

Write posts titled **"7 Best [Service] Companies in [City] (Updated [Year])"** and include your business as #1 alongside 4-6 real competitors. This is the single highest-impact local AI SEO tactic — 44% of AI citations come from "best-style" listicles (Ahrefs data).

**Structure each entry with:**
- Company name (H2 heading per company)
- Google rating and review count
- Specialties and key services
- Price range (approximate)
- Average response time
- Service area coverage
- Pros and cons (be fair — obvious bias reduces citation likelihood)

**Page structure:**
- TLDR box at the top summarizing the top pick and runner-up
- H2 per company with consistent formatting
- FAQ section at the bottom with FAQPage schema
- `dateModified` in Article schema, updated on every refresh

**Critical rules:**
- Update every 30-60 days. Freshness is the #1 AI citation factor for local content.
- Ensure pages are indexed by Bing — ChatGPT uses Bing for web search, not Google.
- Use real competitors with accurate information. AI systems cross-reference data and penalize fabricated entries.
- Create one post per service type per city (e.g., "Best Emergency Plumbers in Phoenix" AND "Best Water Heater Installers in Phoenix").

### 2. Answer Capsules

Start every section with a direct 2-3 sentence answer that works as a standalone citation. AI systems extract these as ready-to-cite fragments without needing surrounding context.

**Example:**
> "For emergency plumbing in Phoenix, Smith Plumbing offers 24/7 service with average response times under 45 minutes and a 4.8-star Google rating across 340 reviews. They serve the entire Phoenix metro including Scottsdale, Tempe, and Mesa with no after-hours surcharge."

**Rules:**
- Place the answer capsule in the first 150 words of the section
- Include the business name, city, key differentiator, and a specific metric
- Keep capsules to 40-60 words for optimal snippet extraction
- Every H2 section should open with its own answer capsule

### 3. Content Freshness for AI Visibility

Content updated within 30-90 days is cited significantly more by AI systems. Gemini in particular strongly prefers content updated within 30 days.

**Meaningful updates (these count):**
- New statistics or data points
- Current-year examples and case studies
- New FAQ questions based on recent customer inquiries
- Revised pricing or service details
- New competitor entries in comparison posts
- Seasonal information relevant to the time of year

**NOT meaningful updates (these don't count):**
- Changing the "last updated" date without substantive changes
- Swapping a screenshot or image
- Minor wording tweaks or grammar fixes
- Rearranging existing content

**Always update `dateModified` in your Article schema when making meaningful changes.** AI systems read this field.

**Seasonal refresh cycle:** Update service pages before their peak season starts. A roofer should refresh "Best Roofers in [City]" in early spring, not mid-summer when everyone is already searching.

### 4. Branded Search Signals

75% of AI brand citations come from editorial media and social platforms, NOT from the business's own website. Your site alone is not enough.

**Actions to build branded signals:**
- **Get on existing "best of" listicles** — Find articles that mention your competitors but not you. Use Ahrefs Brand Radar or Content Explorer to find these gaps. Pitch the author for inclusion.
- **Build Reddit presence** — Reddit is one of the most-cited domains in both ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews. Participate authentically in local and industry subreddits.
- **Build YouTube presence** — YouTube is heavily cited by AI Overviews. Create video content for your key service queries ("How to fix a running toilet in Phoenix").
- **Publish original research** — "We analyzed 500 emergency plumbing calls in Phoenix — here's when pipes burst most" generates citations that generic service pages never will.
- **Encourage branded searches** — Tell customers to "Google our name" or "search for [Brand] reviews." Branded search volume is a signal AI systems use for entity importance.
- **Author attribution** — Every piece of content should have a named author with Person schema and a LinkedIn profile link. AI systems use author identity as a trust signal.
- **Hub-spoke content architecture** — Build topical authority with a pillar page (e.g., "Complete Guide to Plumbing Services in Phoenix") linked to spoke pages for each specific service and neighborhood.

### 5. Entity Consistency

AI systems build entity profiles from cross-referencing multiple sources. Inconsistency weakens your entity signal.

**Requirements:**
- Same exact brand name on every page and every platform
- Same author name and credentials across all content
- Consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) everywhere — website, GBP, Yelp, directories
- LocalBusiness or Organization schema on every page with identical properties
- `sameAs` links in schema pointing to all social profiles (LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, Yelp, etc.)
- FAQ blocks that naturally include brand mentions in answers (e.g., "Yes, Smith Plumbing offers 24/7 emergency service in the Phoenix metro area.")

### 6. AI-Optimized Page Checklist for Local

Use this checklist for every local service page and "best of" post:

- [ ] TLDR summary near the top (2-3 sentences covering the key answer)
- [ ] Answer capsules in the first 150 words of each section
- [ ] Clear H2 sections grouped by use case or service type
- [ ] Bullet lists for features, pricing, and comparisons
- [ ] FAQ section with FAQPage schema at the bottom
- [ ] `dateModified` updated on every meaningful content change
- [ ] Indexed by both Google AND Bing (submit via Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools)
- [ ] 3+ internal links to related service pages and city pages
- [ ] Author bio with credentials and Person schema
- [ ] Schema stack: LocalBusiness + FAQPage + Article + AggregateRating (all on same page)

## Common Mistakes

- **Ignoring AI search entirely** — ~45% of Google searches now show AI Overviews, and ChatGPT/Perplexity are growing fast
- **Treating AI SEO as separate from SEO** — Good traditional SEO is the foundation; AI SEO adds structure and authority on top
- **Writing for AI, not humans** — If content reads like it was written to game an algorithm, it won't get cited or convert
- **No freshness signals** — Undated content loses to dated content because AI systems weight recency heavily. Show when content was last updated
- **Gating all content** — AI can't access gated content. Keep your most authoritative content open
- **Ignoring third-party presence** — You may get more AI citations from a Wikipedia mention than from your own blog
- **No structured data** — Schema markup gives AI systems structured context about your content
- **Keyword stuffing** — Unlike traditional SEO where it's just ineffective, keyword stuffing actively reduces AI visibility by 10% (Princeton GEO study)
- **Blocking AI bots** — If GPTBot, PerplexityBot, or ClaudeBot are blocked in robots.txt, those platforms can't cite you
- **Generic content without data** — "We're the best" won't get cited. "Our customers see 3x improvement in [metric]" will
- **Forgetting to monitor** — You can't improve what you don't measure. Check AI visibility monthly at minimum
